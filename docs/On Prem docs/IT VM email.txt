Hi,

 

Apologies for the delay.

 

We could have hosted externally though we already have/had a solution in place for servers/desktops for several PRP bureaus similar to DFS/Cyber and a DLO remote access via PRP browser as I mentioned before.

 

You may not need the webgui to the VM but we can expand to that if needed.

 

Please externally (not within PRP firewall) ssh using your favorite app or cli (like I do on my macbook) using ssh -p 2211 fvuadmin@72.142.23.10

 

Note from within the VM, ssh outbound works as normal unfortunately the firewall already had port 22 used so I had to choose a different port inbound, this would also be the same for SFTP but nothing is setup yet, the VM is yours and you can install nginx which I did briefly just to test the VM but you can remove re-add it etc…

 

I’ll share the password with you over the phone or I can send a secure link via our corporate 1password.

 

Try logging in… but basically if your going to send sftp files to that OTHER site you can automate this VM to do it or host it on this VM, I can validate sizing later with you.

 

This will give us more freedom since we own the compute plus the pipeline.

 

Regards,
